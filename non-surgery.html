            <p>One of the most promising areas for the development of AR applications in medicine is in the training of medical students. It has a larger tolerance for software instability and inaccuracy, as there are lower stakes in terms of causing potential fatalities should a mistake occur.  This means it represents a stepping stone for technological development in AR, allowing potential implementations to be developed and tested in a lower risk environment. Similarly, patient safety is safeguarded if mistakes are made during skills training with AR. (Zhu et al. 2014) In addition, learning in the medical domain requires ample opportunity to practice and experience all possible variations in different context and circumstances in order to reach the level of competency required in real life applications of clinical skills. In this way, an AR learning environment is promising in facilitating a realistic physical training environment with visual and haptic feedback, real time interaction and instantaneous feedback without an instructor. (Kamphuis et al. 2014)</p>
            
            <p id="text">Traditionally, the teaching of human anatomy involves the dissection of human cadavers to give students a spatial understanding of how different anatomical landmarks are positioned relative to each other. However, ethical and logistical considerations mean such methods are increasingly unsustainable and have largely been replaced by digital interactive methods. (Vidal et al. 2006) Current solutions include the use of virtual environments where anatomy can be explored interactively in 3D. However, the realism of these solutions can be improved through the use of AR, bridging the bounds between purely virtual interactions and real life.</p>

                <p id="note">How AR can be used in Medical Traning</p></center>
            <br>
            
            <p>For example, instead of dissecting a cadaver, AR could allow students to ‘see’ its anatomy as images overlaid on the body. An existing AR system developed specifically for anatomical education uses a camera, a Kinect and a TV. Live video footage of the user is flipped and shown on the TV screen mimicking a mirror function. An anonymous CT dataset is augmented to the user’s body and shown on screen creating the illusion that the user can see inside their own body. A gesture based user interface allow real time manipulation of various methods of visualising CT data, such as sagittal, transverse and coronal slice modes. (Kamphuis et al. 2014)</p>

            <p>Surgery is an area where a large amount of practice is required to attain the level of competency necessary to operate on live patients. The conflict lies in trainee surgeons needing to practice operating on live patients, while patients would like the highest quality of care. This gap is something that AR can help fill. This can be applied to training all types of surgeons but recently the rise of laparoscopic surgery and the complexity of the skills involved compared to normal open surgery means AR can have a greater impact. The inherent loss of 3D perspective and tactile feedback has created a prolonged learning curve for surgeons.(Leblanc et al. 2010) However, the psychomotor skills required in laparoscopy can be broken down into smaller constituent skills that can be repeated until a high level of automation is reached.</p>

            </center>
            <br>
            
            <p>However, according to a study comparing trainees trained using the existing cadaver methods and those trained exclusively on a AR simulator, results showed that overall satisfaction was considerably better for the cadaver model. The analysis of the perceived advantages of the cadaver model included better preservation of tissue consistency and preservation of anatomic planes making the understanding of surgical anatomy, laparoscopic technique and instrument use easier. (Leblanc et al. 2010) This highlights areas where the AR implementations could improve and suggesting that in the current state of technology, AR is still only viable as a tool to use alongside traditional methods, not replace them.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, AR has the potential to provide rich contextual learning for medical students to aid in achieving core competencies, such as decision making, effective teamwork and creative adaptation of global resources towards addressing local priorities. (Frenk et al. 2010) It provides opportunities for more authentic learning and appeals to multiple learning styles, giving students a more personalized and explorative learning experience.

            <hr>
            <p>Augmented reality has shown itself to be effective in the treatment of psychological disorders involving fear. These include acrophobia (fear of heights), entomophobia (fear of insects) and arachnophobia (fear of spiders). (Juan, M. et al. 2005) A head mounted display (HMD) is used in many of these treatments. The visual of the HMD can also be viewed from a monitor so that the therapist may share their view. In these treatments, two factors are often analyzed in order to judge the effectiveness of the AR devices in these treatments: sense of presence and reality judgment. Sense of presence may be described as the “sensation of being there”. Reality judgment is the determining of whether an experience is real. (Juan, M. et al. 2005) In experiments attempting to measure these factors, it has been shown that an HMD with AR-tags (serving as the marker) is very capable of producing high levels of both. (Giglioli, I.A.C. et al., 2015) Experiments have also been conducted to compare the effectiveness of visible and invisible AR-tags which have demonstrated that the invisible tags elicit a higher sense of presence and levels of anxiety. (Giglioli, I.A.C. et al., 2015)</p>
            
            <p>Moving onto the actual treatments of the phobias, it was found that the effectiveness of in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip right" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="3" title="In vivo exposure refers to the direct confrontation of feared objects, activities, or situations by a patient">vivo treatments</span> and AR treatments were very similar when tested. In addition, both were shown to be potent in terms of reduction in anxiety and avoidance. (Giglioli, I.A.C. et al., 2015) One example of a method of measurement is a behavioral avoidance test (BAT), where how long patients can stay in the presence of certain stimuli is measured (for example, virtual spiders are generated to treat arachnophobia). Moreover, an AR treatment has many other advantages. In AR, the source of the fear is virtual and cannot put the patient in harm's way. In addition, the therapist can stop and restart the AR program whenever they want to cater to the patient. There is also an element of randomness in in vivo treatments (e.g. there is no direct way to control the spiders). This randomness is removed in AR. AR also allows for the creation of very precise situations, allowing the therapist to cater to specific fears or fears that relate to a specific location. This is also more efficient as travelling to specific locations and/or acquiring certain species of insects will take time. (Juan, M. et al. 2005)</p>
            
            <p>For an example of entomophobia or arachnophobia treatment, we consider a study “Using Augmented Reality To Treat Phobias” done by Juan, M. et al. Here, the AR was achieved by attaching a USB camera to an HMD which would output what it sees to a monitor that a therapist can view and within the HMD itself. After initialization, a loop is undergone for every frame of the video. The AR system registers the frame then determines whether markers exist in the frame. A virtual element is then created on the marker using an appropriate transformation matrix. In this AR system, the therapist exerts a strong hold over his environment. Elements can be made to appear or disappear, they can be made to move, remain still or more back to their starting position or even grow in size (Figure 1). (Juan, M. et al. 2005) </p>

            <p>In this controlled environment, the therapist is able to add a sense of “progression” to further aid in the treatment process. Comparing the subjects at the start and the end of the study, all subjects were incapable of even nearing real spiders or cockroaches to begin with; but by the end, all subjects were capable of doing so, even killing them. This is demonstrative of an AR treatment being as successful as in vivo treatment. Furthermore, to show this, sense of presence and judgment of reality were tested with an interview, revealing that the AR was able to induce a similar sense of anxiety to that induced by a real encounter.

            <hr>            
            <p>Moving on from treating psychological ailments, AR has been demonstrated to be effective in treating physical trauma in recent years due to the evolution of technology, increasing availability and decreasing cost of manufacture. (Al-Issa, H., et al.) With greater distribution of product comes greater range of types of treatment, spanning through a multitude of different conditions. These entail: traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, cerebral palsy, disability of upper limbs, strokes and sclerosis. (Al-Issa, H., et al.) Comparing AR to virtual reality (VR), it seems that research on the effects of VR rehabilitation have been less effective with varying outcomes and “methodical limitations that limit generalizability.” (Galvin J., et al.) </p>
            
            <p>For physical trauma, outcome variables such as speed and stride length are often used to determine how effective treatments are. It is no different for AR treatments. In using AR to treat Parkinson’s disease, results showed that all patients had significant improvements in gait velocity, (Al-Issa, H., et al.) indicative of ameliorated cognitive performance. (Jabourian, A., et al.) Increased stride length is also commonly observed which is linked to a greater sense of attention. AR treatment aiding the recovery of stroke victims also demonstrated “meaningful improvements in gait velocity, stride length, walking endurance and obstacle clearance capacity”. (Al-Issa, H., et al.) Similar results, relating to speed and stride length were also exhibited in the AR treatment of multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. </p>
            
            <p>Benefits of this type of physical trauma treatment are shared with those of psychological treatment, including a greater control that the doctor exerts over the system and hence decreasing risk of unexpected occurrences or further injury. However, a disadvantage that may only be applied to the treating of physical trauma is the fact that AR equipment may be heavy. (Al-Issa, H., et al.) Heavy equipment may prove to be inappropriate to individuals with serious physical injury. Furthermore, diseases such as Parkinson’s disease tend to occur in older patients. Such patients may find difficulty in using the AR equipment.</p>
